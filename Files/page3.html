        <li>Bed Wars is a Minecraft mini-game popularized by Hypixel, the largest Minecraft server.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In Bed Wars, players spawn on an island and collect resources to get swords, blocks, tools, and other special items. Players also have a bed that they must protect, as the bed breaking results in players no longer being able to respawn(Streamerpedia, n.d.).</li>
        <br>
        <li>It is a player/team survival game where players battle across floating islands, attacking enemy beds and defending their own, in an attempt to be the last one standing.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Although it's not formally an e-sport(since competitive combat is only a minor in Minecraft), the strategies and tournaments made by the players make it intense and entertaining.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fun Fact: You can get consecutive win streaks in Bed Wars. Late Minecraft content creator Technoblade first held the world record of 1,000 Bed Wars win streak! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOcs4LmjUfg">Watch it here.</a></li>
